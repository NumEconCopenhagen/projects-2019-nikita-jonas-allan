# Modelproject

In our model project we made a Cournot model for Oligopoly with 3 competing firms. In this model the user can specify the demand on the given market, level of substitution between goods that are produced by the 3 competing firms and the different opperating cost for these firms. The final output for this model is the equilibrium quantity for these three firms
Furthermore, we made the same model but for monopoly instead. Here the user can define the opperating cost and the demand on the market. The final output is the equilibrium quantity.
