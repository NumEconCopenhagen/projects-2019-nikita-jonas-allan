# Dataproject

First Python project

In our project we will conduct a basic descriptive economic of Danish GDP and it's components. To do this, we used DST data for danish private consumption, public consumption, investments, imports and exports. We will derive net export from import and export, derive total GDP as a sum of our variables. In the end we will make a graph which shows development of GDP and its variables.

Notes: 
    * code.py is the pure python code, which we made in VSC
    * Project 1.ipynb is the interactive file
    * This project was made by Jonas, Nikita and Allan
